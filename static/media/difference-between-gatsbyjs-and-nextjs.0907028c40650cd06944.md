### Difference between GatsbyJS & NextJS.

When it comes to building modern web applications, choosing the right framework can make all the difference. Two popular frameworks that have gained significant popularity among developers are GatsbyJS and NextJS. While they share some similarities, there are also several key differences between the two. In this blog post, we'll explore the differences between GatsbyJS and NextJS, so you can choose the right framework for your next project.

What is GatsbyJS?

GatsbyJS is a static site generator built on top of ReactJS. It allows developers to create fast and performant websites that can be deployed on a variety of hosting platforms, including GitHub Pages, Netlify, and AWS. GatsbyJS uses GraphQL to manage data and content, which makes it easy to integrate with a wide range of content management systems (CMS) and APIs.

What is NextJS?

NextJS is a server-side rendering (SSR) framework for ReactJS. It allows developers to build scalable and SEO-friendly web applications that can be deployed on any server. NextJS provides several features out of the box, including automatic code splitting, prefetching, and serverless functions, making it an excellent choice for building complex web applications.

Static vs. Dynamic

The most significant difference between GatsbyJS and NextJS is how they handle data and content. GatsbyJS is a static site generator, which means that it generates HTML, CSS, and JavaScript files at build time based on the data and content it retrieves from CMS or APIs. Once the build is complete, the resulting files can be deployed to a hosting platform, and the website can be served to users. This makes GatsbyJS ideal for building websites that don't require frequent content updates, such as blogs, portfolios, and marketing websites.

NextJS, on the other hand, is a server-side rendering framework, which means that it generates HTML on the server at runtime. This allows it to handle dynamic content more efficiently and makes it suitable for building complex web applications that require frequent content updates, such as e-commerce platforms, social networks, and content-heavy websites.

Performance

Both GatsbyJS and NextJS provide excellent performance, but they achieve it in different ways. GatsbyJS generates static files, which means that the website loads faster since the files don't need to be generated dynamically. NextJS, on the other hand, generates HTML at runtime, which can result in slower initial load times but faster subsequent page loads since the content is cached on the server.

Conclusion

In conclusion, GatsbyJS and NextJS are both powerful frameworks for building modern web applications. GatsbyJS is ideal for building static websites that don't require frequent content updates, while NextJS is more suitable for building dynamic web applications that require real-time updates. When deciding which framework to use, consider the type of website you're building, your content management system, and your performance requirements.

We hope this blog post has helped you understand the differences between GatsbyJS and NextJS. Happy coding!
