### Future of javascript.

JavaScript is one of the most popular programming languages in the world and has been evolving rapidly over the years. It's used to create dynamic and interactive web applications, mobile apps, and even server-side applications. In this blog post, we'll explore the future of JavaScript and what we can expect from this language in the coming years.

1. WebAssembly

WebAssembly is a low-level binary format that can run in modern web browsers alongside JavaScript. It provides a way to execute code at near-native speeds and is ideal for computationally intensive tasks. With the increasing popularity of WebAssembly, we can expect JavaScript to be used more as a high-level language for writing and interacting with WebAssembly modules.

2. Functional Programming

Functional programming has been gaining popularity in recent years, and JavaScript is no exception. With the introduction of arrow functions, rest and spread operators, and other features, JavaScript has become more functional than ever. We can expect functional programming to become even more prevalent in the future, with libraries like Ramda and Lodash making it easier to write functional code.

3. Artificial Intelligence

Artificial Intelligence is changing the way we interact with technology, and JavaScript is no exception. With the introduction of libraries like TensorFlow.js and Brain.js, JavaScript developers can now build and train machine learning models right in the browser. We can expect AI to become even more accessible to JavaScript developers in the future, with more libraries and tools being developed to make it easier to build and train models.

4. Serverless Architecture

Serverless architecture has been gaining popularity in recent years, and JavaScript is well-suited for this type of architecture. With platforms like AWS Lambda, Google Cloud Functions, and Microsoft Azure Functions, developers can run JavaScript code without having to worry about managing servers or infrastructure. We can expect serverless architecture to become even more prevalent in the future, with more services and tools being developed to make it easier to build and deploy serverless applications.

5. Typescript

TypeScript is a superset of JavaScript that adds static typing and other features to the language. It has been gaining popularity in recent years, and we can expect more developers to adopt TypeScript in the future. With TypeScript, developers can catch errors at compile-time instead of runtime, making it easier to write and maintain large-scale applications.

Conclusion

JavaScript has come a long way since its inception and is showing no signs of slowing down. With the introduction of WebAssembly, functional programming, AI, serverless architecture, and TypeScript, we can expect JavaScript to continue to evolve and become even more versatile in the future. As a developer, it's essential to keep up with these changes and embrace new technologies to stay ahead of the curve.
